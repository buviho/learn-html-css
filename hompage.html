                <p>
                    Wine has long played an important role in religion. 
                    Red wine was associated with blood by the ancient Egyptians and was used by both the Greek cult of Dionysus and the Romans in their Bacchanalia. 
                    Judaism also incorporates it in the Kiddush, and Christianity in the Eucharist. 
                    Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Israeli wine cultures are still connected to these ancient roots. 
                    Similarly the largest wine regions in Italy, Spain, and France have heritages in connection to sacramental wine, likewise, viticulture traditions in the 
                    Southwestern United States started within New Spain as Catholic friars and monks first produced wines in New Mexico and California.
